#### Puppet Tasks

@ol[](false)
- Tasks are single actions that you run on target machines in your infrastructure.
- Best for changes that arenâ€™t about enforcing the state of machines.
- You can write tasks in any programming language that can run on the target nodes.
- Tasks can be chained together into Plans (not covered today).
